Flag cover, before the cancellation or removal happens
For the policy and car insurance cover options, 
e.g. Protected No Claim Discount:
>We will not refund any car insurance 
premium if you have made a car insurance claim or if one has been made against you during the period of cover (regardless of whether you pay annually or by monthly instalments under a credit agreement).
>If you pay by instalments under a credit agreement, you must pay to us (1) all instalment payments that have already fallen due under the credit agreement and remain unpaid, and (2) the total remaining balance under the credit agreement.
>If we agree to pay your claim and you have not paid the amounts due to us under (1) and (2) above, we may reduce the amount that we pay in settlement of your claim by the amount that you owe us. Alternatively, we may write to you asking you for the full payment.
For Green Flag breakdown cover:
>We will not refund any Green Flag breakdown cover premium if you have made a Green Flag breakdown cover claim during the period of cover (regardless of whether you pay annually or by monthly instalments under a credit agreement).

Please note
>It’s your responsibility to inform anyone 
insured under this policy that it has been

>If you live in Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, you must return your certificate of motor insurance to us 
after cancellation. This applies whether we cancel the policy or you cancel it.
If we need to cancel the policy

after cancellation. This applies whether we cancel the policy or you cancel it. 
Why we might cancel the policy 
We’ll only cancel the policy if we have valid 
reasons for doing so. For example:
>If you’ve failed to co-operate with us, or 
send us information or documentation as described in your policy, and that has 
affected our ability to process your claim, or deal with your policy.
>If your circumstances have changed in such a way that you no longer meet our criteria for providing motor insurance.
>If you’ve used threatening or abusive behaviour or language, or you’ve intimidated or bullied our staff or suppliers.
>If we have good reasons to suspect fraud.
Refunding the premium
If we cancel the policy, we’ll charge for the time 
you’ve had the policy, and refund the rest of the

We won’t refund any premium if you’ve made a 
claim, or if you’ve had a claim against you if you have chosen to pay by lump-sum.
If you pay by instalments under a credit 
agreement, you must pay to us (1) all instalment payments that have already fallen due under the credit agreement and remain unpaid, and (2) the total remaining balance under the credit agreement.
If we agree to pay your claim and you have not 
paid the amounts due to us under (1) and (2) above, we may reduce the amount that we pay in settlement of your claim by the amount that you owe us. Alternatively, we may write to you asking you for the full payment.
If the claim is later settled as not your fault, any 
refund that is due will be issued once the claim has been closed.

your renewal premium in line with the NCD scale that we’re using at the time you renew.

policy must do all of the following:
>Make sure your car is roadworthy.
>Take all reasonable steps to protect your car
and its contents from loss or damage.
>Make sure any property left in an open or

standard specification, including optional 
extras.
If you wish to modify your car, you must tell us 
what modifications you want to make, and we 
must agree to them beforehand. Modifications include changes to the 
appearance or the performance of your car, 
including wheels, suspension, bodywork, engine and any additional software features (excluding those provided free as software updates by the manufacturer). This is not a complete list.

information or inform us of any changes, this could invalidate your policy or mean we don’t 
pay claims in full or at all.Fraud
You must be honest in your dealings with us at 
all times.
We won’t pay a claim that is in any way 
fraudulent, false or exaggerated. 
If you, any person insured under this policy, 
or anyone acting on your behalf attempts to 
deceive us, or knowingly makes a fraudulent, false or exaggerated claim, we may:
>Cancel your policy.
>Reject your claim and any following claims.
>Keep any premium you have paid.
What happens if we discover fraud
If we discover fraud, we have the right to:
>Cancel any other products you hold with 
U K Insurance Limited.
>Cancel this policy, if the fraud happened 
under any other policy you hold with U K Insurance Limited. 
>Share information about your behaviour with other organisations to prevent further fraud. 
We may also involve the relevant authorities who can bring criminal proceedings. 
Other insurance
If any loss, damage or liability is also covered 
by another insurance policy, we won’t cover more than our share of the claim, unless you’re claiming for Personal accident (see ‘Personal accident’ on page 21).
People involved in this contract
This policy is a contract between the 
policyholder and U K Insurance Limited. Nobody 
else has any rights they can enforce under it, except under the Road Traffic Act or anywhere 
else under applicable law.

territorial limits.
Page 36Car sharing

your car as part of a car sharing arrangement 
(carrying passengers for payment). This is so long as: 
>Your car isn’t made or adapted to carry more 
than 8 passengers and a driver. 
>You’re not carrying the passengers as part of a business. 
>You’re not making a profit from the passengers’ payments or making a profit from allowing someone to drive.
>You’re not renting your car out or using a 
peer-to-peer hire scheme to do so. 
If you’re not sure whether we’ll cover your car if 
it’s used as part of a car sharing arrangement, please get in touch.
When we can act on your behalf
We’re entitled to do either of the following: 
>Take over and carry out the negotiation, 
defence or settlement of any claim in your name, or in the name of any other person covered by this policy. 
>Start legal proceedings in your name, or in the name of any other person connected to this policy. This can be for your benefit or 
our own benefit.Telling us about changes

you received your quote. For example, you must tell us if:
>Anything about your car changes.
>You or any other driver have any claims 
or convictions that you haven’t already told us about.
>There are any changes to how your car is 
used, for example if you change from social, domestic and pleasure use to business use.
>There are any modifications made to 
your car (see ‘Modifications to your car’ on page 36).
>You want to add another driver to the policy, 
or make any other change to who can drive your car.
>You want to change to a higher level of cover, for example from Third Party, Fire and Theft to Comprehensive.

You must tell us as soon as possible if:
>You change the address where your car is 
normally kept overnight.

occupation.
>Anyone covered by the policy passes their 
driving test.
>Any contact details change, for example, 
your email address.

These changes may mean we need to increase or reduce the premium, or in some cases cancel your policy.
Page 37How the policy works
How the policy worksBefore renewal 
You must tell us about any incident or motoring 
offence that’s happened since your cover started. For example, if anyone covered by the policy has had:
>Any motoring convictions, endorsements, 
penalty points, fixed penalties (excluding parking penalties), speed camera offences or disqualifications.
>Any incidents, thefts or losses, even if they didn’t claim or were not to blame.
>Any insurance cancelled by another insurer for fraud or misrepresentation.
If you don’t tell us about changes
If you don’t provide correct and complete 
information or inform us of any changes, this could invalidate your policy or mean we don’t 
pay claims in full or at all. 
Changing your policy
You can make a temporary or permanent change to the policy at any time during the 
year. 
If you do this, you may have to pay an 
administration fee as well as any additional premium. Please see your car insurance details
for more information on the administration fee. 
Paying your premium
If you change your car insurance and there’s an extra premium to pay, you can pay this at the time of the change, or add it to your monthly payments.
What happens if we can’t collect your payment
If we have been unable to collect the instalment 
payment(s) due under your credit agreement on
the date(s) due, we will write to you in order to 
give you the opportunity to make the payment(s).
If any instalment amount remain(s) unpaid by 
the date we set out in our letter, we will give you 7 days’ notice that we will cancel your policy, 
and inform you in writing when this cancellation has taken place.
If your credit agreement is cancelled, the 
cancellation date may be different to the cancellation date of the insurance policy.If there’s a claim while you owe us money
If you have made a claim, or one has been made
 against you before the date that we 
cancel the policy you must pay to us (1) all 
instalment payments that have already fallen 
due under the  credit agreement and remain 
unpaid, and (2) the total remaining balance under the credit agreement. If we agree to pay your claim and you have not paid the amounts due to us under 
(1) and (2) above, we may 
reduce the amount that we pay in settlement of your claim by the amount
that you owe us. 
Alternatively, if you are in arrears at the time of the claim, we may refuse your claim.
If you owe us an additional premium
We may refuse your claim. If we agree to allow 
your claim, we may deduct any additional premium
from any claim payment we make to you, or we 
may proportionately reduce any claim payment.
Your right to cancel the policy 
or remove any optional cover
You can cancel the policy, or remove 
any optional cover (including Green Flag 
breakdown cover) you’ve added, at any time – just get in touch with us. The text below explains whether we’ll charge you and how much we’ll refund in each situation. 
If the cancellation or removal happens before 
your cover starts

your 14-day cooling-off period

refund the rest of the premium paid.

the 14-day cooling off period 
We’ll charge for the time you’ve had cover, 
plus an administration fee, and refund any remaining premium paid.How the policy works continued
